## Description 1

I plan to explore how the composition and value of global food imports have changed over time across major commodities and countries.

My goal is to use a suite of 6–10 static visualizations to illustrate trends in international food trade, highlight which countries or commodity categories drive the largest import growth, and examine whether certain regions are becoming more dependent on specific food types (e.g., grains, fruits, or animal products).

The broader policy motivation is to understand the dynamics of global food supply chains — which can inform trade policy, food security planning, and sustainability discussions.

## Data Sources

### Data Source 1: U.S. Food Imports

URL: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/us-food-imports

Size: 19839 rows, 8 columns

This dataset from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service (ERS) reports the annual value of imported food commodities by country, category, and subcategory.
Variables include Commodity, Country, UOM, Category, SubCategory, YearNum, and FoodValue.
The data are complete, well-structured, and require minimal cleaning.
Initial exploration shows consistent identifiers (Country, YearNum), allowing both time-series and cross-sectional analyses.
With a mix of numeric, categorical, and temporal fields, the dataset is suitable for diverse visualization types such as line charts, bar charts, maps, and hierarchical treemaps.

## Description 2

How often do NBA players exceed their own average or median scoring expectations — and who are the most consistent overperformers?

I plan to visualize how NBA players perform relative to their own scoring expectations, using player-level data from Basketball Reference.

The project examines which players most frequently exceed their average or median points per game and how consistent those performances are across the season.

By comparing actual outcomes to personal baselines instead of betting lines, this analysis captures the same “expected value” concept — showing which players are steady contributors versus streaky scorers.

The visualizations will combine statistical clarity with storytelling, highlighting overperformance, volatility, and patterns of consistency among top NBA players.

### Data Source 2: A Data Visualization of NBA Scoring Consistency and Overperformance

URL: https://www.basketball-reference.com/

Size: ~10,000+ rows (player-season records)

Provides player-level per-game data (points, minutes, efficiency, etc.) across NBA seasons. Data can be filtered for players with regular betting lines (e.g., stars with 25+ scoring lines).
