        Over the past few decades, the United States has become increasingly dependent on international markets to meet its food demand. While the nation remains one of the world's largest agricultural producers, the volume and value of imported food products have expanded dramatically, reshaping the structure of the American food system. From fresh fruits and vegetables to seafood, beverages, and processed goods, imported foods now account for a substantial and growing share of what Americans consume. Several forces have driven this trend. Globalization and trade liberalization, trade agreements such as NAFTA, have lowered barriers to food imports and encouraged multinational supply chains. At the same time, shifts in consumer preferences toward year-round availability, dietary diversity, and exotic or specialty products have created sustained demand for imports beyond what domestic producers can supply.
